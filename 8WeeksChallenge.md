 # 8 Weeks SQL Challenge :thought_balloon:

I embarked on this program to further push my SQL skills, honed through various courses I've completed in recent months. 
The program encompasses a total of eight projects that delve into a variety of topics, including Data Analysis, Data Transformation, and Data Cleaning. 
While I'm still actively working on some of the projects, feel free to reach out if you have any questions about the challenges I've encountered.
